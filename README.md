# Algomox E-online voting system 
This E - Voting System Was Developed With golan(gin Framework) and cassandra database. 


This Voting System web application built using golang can serve as the automated voting system for organizations and/or institutions. The system works like the common election manual system of voting whereas the system must be populated by the list of the positions, candidates, and voters. The algomox E-voting system can help a certain organization like algomox or school to minimize the voting time duration because aside providing the voters an online platform to vote, the system will automatically count the votes for each candidate. The system has 2 sides of the user interface which are the administrator and voters side. The admin user is in charge to populate and manage the data of the system and the voter side which is where the voters will choose their candidate and submit their votes.

 [go get "github.com/go-chi/chi"]
 [go get "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"]
 [go get "github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go"]
 [go get "github.com/gin-contrib/sessions" ]

 **2. open the project folder**
1.Initializer foler contains inital database setup and loading env variable

to login there are two choice admin or voter if your voter you should ask that 
from admin for mail and password

for admin login i alread mention above he can sigin using api only for securty
and password are stored in hash value .

**4. Data base model**

//user model or admin
type Users struct {
	Email    string `json:"email"`
	Password string `json:"password"`
}

//voter model
type Voter struct {
	ID        gocql.UUID `json:"id"`
	FirstName string     `json:"firstname"`
	LastName  string     `json:"lastname"`
	Email     string     `json:"email"`
	Password  string     `json:"password"`
	Verified  bool       `json:"verified"`
	Voted     bool       `json:"voted"`
}

//position model
type Position struct {
	ID       gocql.UUID
	Name     string `json:"name"`
	Priority int    `json:"priority"`
}

//candidates model

type Candidate struct {
	ID       gocql.UUID
	FullName string `json:"fullname"`
	Bio      string `json:"bio"`
	Position string `json:"position"`
}

//votes model
type Votes struct {
	Voter     gocql.UUID `json:"voterid"`
	Position  string     `json:"position"`
	Candidate string     `json:"candidate"`
}


## How the system works
Administrator is required to have created candidates. 
Before creating candidates, the admin must have created positions
After doing this, the voters can vote (provided that they are registered and verified)


## How do voters get verified ?
UUID  is generated for different voter. 
After login as voter he/she can verified and then he/she can vote
